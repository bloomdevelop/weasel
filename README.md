# Weasel
Performance oriented bot for Stoat, written with just TypeScript and Bun. Possibly replacing Silk due how bad the codebase was it in the current state.


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun dev
# Will be replaced with some sort of build system
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.2. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
